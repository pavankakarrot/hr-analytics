  - EDA: satisfaction vs hours/projects/tenure  
  - Correlation analysis & feature summaries  
  - Initial predictive model for churn  


# Outlier Detection Methods Explained

## IQR Method (Box Plot Method)
- **Analogy:** Like finding shirts that are unusually small or large in a clothing store  
- **How it works:**  
  - Computes Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile)  
  - Defines the “normal range” as Q1 – 1.5×IQR to Q3 + 1.5×IQR (IQR = Q3 – Q1)  
- **Flagging outliers:** Any value below Q1 – 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR is flagged as unusual  

## Z-score Method
- **Analogy:** Like comparing test scores to the class average  
- **How it works:**  
  - Calculates Z-score = (value – mean) / standard deviation  
- **Flagging outliers:** Any value with |Z-score| > 3 (more than 3 SDs from the mean) is considered unusual

|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Satisfaction Level**| - Moderate overall mood (0.63/1.0)  <br> - Some very unhappy employees (as low as 0.09)  <br> - Potential risk for turnover |
| **Last Evaluation**   | - Generally positive reviews (0.72/1.0)  <br> - No extremely poor performers  <br> - Consistent evaluation system |
| **Project Count**     | - Most employees handle 3–4 projects  <br> - A few manage 7 projects  <br> - Burnout risk at higher project loads |
| **Monthly Hours**     | - Standard ~40 hours/week on average  <br> - Some working up to 77.5 hours/week  <br> - Work–life balance concerns |
| **Tenure**            | - Many outliers (extremely long or short stays)  <br> - High variation in stay duration  <br> - Retention challenges evident |
| **Work Accidents**    | - 15% accident rate  <br> - Safety concerns  <br> - Need for stronger safety protocols |
| **Left Company**      | - 17% turnover rate (above industry avg.)  <br> - Immediate attention needed to reduce churn |
| **Promotions**        | - Very low promotion rate (2%)  <br> - Career growth concerns  <br> - Potential driver of turnover |



# Comprehensive Analysis of HR Visualizations

## Turnover Distribution (Basic Bar Chart)
- **17% turnover rate**  
- **Key Risk:** High turnover cost impact

## Project Load vs Hours (Box Plot & Histogram)
- **Optimal project load:** 3–4 projects  
- **Critical finding:** 100% turnover for employees handling 7 projects  
- **Insight:** Identified workload threshold beyond which churn spikes

## Monthly Hours vs Satisfaction (Scatter Plot)
- **High hours (240–315/month):** Near-zero satisfaction  
- **Sweet spot:** 210–280 hours/month with satisfaction scores of 0.7–0.9  
- **Implication:** Cultural pressure impacts employee morale

## Satisfaction by Tenure (Box Plot & Histogram)
- **Two distinct turnover groups:**  
  - Short-tenure + low satisfaction  
  - Medium-tenure + high satisfaction  
- **Critical tenure mark:** Around 4 years

## Salary Distribution by Tenure
- **No clear correlation** between tenure and salary  
- **Limited salary progression** over time  
- **Retention challenge:** Compensation not keeping pace with experience

## Monthly Hours vs Last Evaluation (Scatter Plot)
- **Overworked high performers** are more likely to leave  
- **Positive correlation** between hours worked and evaluation scores  
- **Highlight:** Work–life balance issues driving churn

## Promotions & Department Analysis
- **Very low promotion rate:** ~2% company-wide  
- **Consistent turnover** across all departments  
- **Conclusion:** Retention issue spans the entire organization

# Key Correlations
- **Hours vs Projects:** *r* = 0.42 (strong positive)  
- **Satisfaction vs Left:** *r* = –0.39 (strong negative)  
- **Evaluation vs Projects:** *r* = 0.35 (moderate positive)  


# 6. Business Insights

## Key Findings

### Workload Issues
- 7+ projects ⇒ 100% turnover  
- Optimal load: 3–4 projects  
- Overworking is prevalent  

### Satisfaction Patterns
- Two turnover groups:  
  - Short tenure + low satisfaction  
  - Medium tenure + high satisfaction  
- Critical tenure mark identified at ~4 years  

### Performance Relations
- Positive correlation between hours worked and evaluation scores  
- Very low promotion rate (~2%)  
- Consistent turnover across all departments  

### Retention Risks
- Overall turnover rate: 17%  
- Work–life balance concerns
